 The project involves creating a web based solution to provide an integrated environment for clients to search for and subsequently book bus ticket for different buses existing in Bangladesh. This site will allow clients to search based on dates, from and to locations. In this system, Customer can create account by using user ID and password. By using the account customer, manager and employees can see their information what they want to know.
